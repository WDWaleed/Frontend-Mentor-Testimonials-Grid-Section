## Acknowledgments

I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JS from Zach Goll's You Tube channel. Amazing guy who explained all concepts clearly and even clarified most of the problems I was facing as a beginner.

Kevin Powell helped a lot with one of his grid tutorials. It made me realize the importance of using rem instead of px, and I found out out about a few useful properties as well such as "gap".
